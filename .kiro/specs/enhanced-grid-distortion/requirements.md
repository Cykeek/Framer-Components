# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing GridDistortion Framer component by adapting and integrating advanced visual effects from the ReactBits grid distortion example. The enhancement will maintain the current Framer-native architecture while adding more sophisticated distortion patterns, improved visual fidelity, and additional customization options that make the component more versatile for professional design projects.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Framer designer, I want enhanced distortion patterns that create more visually compelling effects, so that I can create more professional and engaging interactive backgrounds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user hovers over the component THEN the system SHALL apply multiple distortion algorithms including radial, wave, and spiral patterns
2. WHEN the distortion strength is adjusted THEN the system SHALL smoothly interpolate between different distortion intensities without visual artifacts
3. WHEN multiple distortion types are enabled THEN the system SHALL blend them seamlessly using configurable mixing ratios

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer using the component, I want additional distortion pattern options beyond the current radial effect, so that I can match different design aesthetics and use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a distortion pattern THEN the system SHALL provide options for "radial", "wave", "spiral", "turbulence", and "magnetic" effects
2. WHEN switching between patterns THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth transitions without jarring visual changes
3. WHEN combining patterns THEN the system SHALL allow layering multiple effects with individual strength controls

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Framer user, I want improved visual quality and performance optimizations, so that the component works smoothly across different devices and screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component renders THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps performance on devices with moderate GPU capabilities
2. WHEN the screen resolution changes THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust rendering quality to maintain performance
3. WHEN the component is used in complex Framer projects THEN the system SHALL efficiently manage GPU resources without impacting other components

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a designer, I want more granular control over the grid appearance and behavior, so that I can fine-tune the visual output to match my design requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adjusting grid properties THEN the system SHALL provide controls for grid scale, rotation, skew, and perspective
2. WHEN modifying grid lines THEN the system SHALL support gradient colors, dashed patterns, and animated line styles
3. WHEN the grid interacts with distortion THEN the system SHALL allow independent control of grid and image distortion intensities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Framer component user, I want enhanced mouse interaction options, so that I can create more sophisticated hover and click behaviors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the mouse enters the component THEN the system SHALL support configurable entry animations and easing curves
2. WHEN the mouse moves within the component THEN the system SHALL provide options for trail effects, multiple cursor influence points, and velocity-based distortion
3. WHEN the mouse exits the component THEN the system SHALL smoothly return to the rest state with configurable exit timing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the enhanced component to maintain full compatibility with the existing Framer property controls system, so that existing projects continue to work without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN upgrading from the current version THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing property controls and their default values
2. WHEN new properties are added THEN the system SHALL provide sensible defaults that don't break existing implementations
3. WHEN the component is used in Framer THEN the system SHALL continue to work as a single-file, dependency-free solution

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious designer, I want quality and performance presets, so that I can easily optimize the component for different use cases without manual tuning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting a performance preset THEN the system SHALL provide "high-quality", "balanced", and "performance" options
2. WHEN a preset is applied THEN the system SHALL automatically configure shader complexity, texture resolution, and update frequency
3. WHEN switching presets THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition between quality levels without visual disruption
