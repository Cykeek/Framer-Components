# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates an alternative grid distortion component inspired by the ReactBits grid distortion example. Rather than modifying the existing GridDistortion component, this will be a new standalone component that implements the specific visual effects and interaction patterns from the ReactBits example while maintaining Framer compatibility and the single-file architecture pattern.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Framer designer, I want a ReactBits-style grid distortion component, so that I can recreate the specific visual aesthetic and interaction patterns from the ReactBits example.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user hovers over the component THEN the system SHALL create distortion effects that match the ReactBits example's visual behavior
2. WHEN the mouse moves across the surface THEN the system SHALL apply displacement mapping that follows the ReactBits interaction model
3. WHEN the distortion occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain the smooth, organic feel characteristic of the ReactBits implementation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want this component to work seamlessly in Framer projects, so that I can use it alongside other Framer components without compatibility issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component is created THEN the system SHALL follow the single-file, dependency-free architecture required for Framer
2. WHEN property controls are configured THEN the system SHALL use Framer's native ControlType system for all customization options
3. WHEN the component is used in Framer THEN the system SHALL integrate with Framer's canvas and property panel without requiring external dependencies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a designer, I want customizable visual parameters that match the ReactBits example's capabilities, so that I can adapt the effect to different design contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adjusting distortion parameters THEN the system SHALL provide controls for intensity, radius, and falloff that replicate the ReactBits behavior
2. WHEN modifying the grid appearance THEN the system SHALL support the visual styling options present in the ReactBits example
3. WHEN changing the background image THEN the system SHALL maintain the distortion quality and performance characteristics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious user, I want the component to run efficiently in web browsers, so that it doesn't impact the overall performance of my Framer site.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component renders THEN the system SHALL use WebGL shaders optimized for the ReactBits distortion algorithm
2. WHEN multiple instances are used THEN the system SHALL manage GPU resources efficiently to prevent performance degradation
3. WHEN the component is viewed on different devices THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth 60fps performance across desktop and mobile browsers

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Framer user, I want intuitive property controls that make the ReactBits effects easy to customize, so that I can achieve the desired visual result without technical expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the component THEN the system SHALL provide clearly labeled controls that correspond to the ReactBits example's parameters
2. WHEN adjusting settings THEN the system SHALL show real-time preview of changes within the Framer canvas
3. WHEN using default settings THEN the system SHALL produce visually appealing results that closely match the ReactBits example

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer integrating this component, I want it to handle edge cases gracefully, so that it works reliably across different browsers and usage scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WebGL is not available THEN the system SHALL provide a graceful fallback that maintains basic functionality
2. WHEN images fail to load THEN the system SHALL display appropriate fallback content without breaking the component
3. WHEN the component is resized THEN the system SHALL maintain visual quality and proper aspect ratios
