# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a secure authentication system for Framer projects that protects credentials from being exposed in client-side code, network packets, cookies, or browser storage. The system will use server-side validation and cryptographic techniques to ensure password security while maintaining a seamless user experience within Framer's constraints.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to protect my Framer pages with a password, so that only authorized users can access sensitive content without exposing the password in client-side code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits a protected page THEN the system SHALL display a password input form
2. WHEN a user enters an incorrect password THEN the system SHALL display an error message without revealing the correct password
3. WHEN a user enters the correct password THEN the system SHALL grant access to the protected content
4. IF the password is correct THEN the system SHALL maintain the authenticated state during the session
5. WHEN inspecting network traffic THEN the actual password SHALL NOT be visible in any requests or responses

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication credentials to be completely hidden from client-side inspection, so that the security cannot be bypassed by examining the code or network traffic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the component source code THEN no plaintext passwords SHALL be visible
2. WHEN inspecting browser developer tools THEN no authentication secrets SHALL be discoverable
3. WHEN analyzing network packets THEN password validation SHALL occur server-side only
4. IF a user attempts to bypass authentication THEN the system SHALL prevent access without server validation
5. WHEN the component is published THEN no sensitive data SHALL be embedded in the Framer package

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Framer user, I want the authentication system to work seamlessly within Framer's component system, so that I can easily configure and use it without complex setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the component THEN the system SHALL provide Framer property controls for basic settings
2. WHEN setting up authentication THEN the system SHALL guide users through secure credential configuration
3. IF the component fails to authenticate THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options
4. WHEN the authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition to the protected content
5. WHEN using the component THEN it SHALL integrate naturally with Framer's canvas and preview modes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want multiple layers of protection against common attack vectors, so that my content remains secure even if one security measure is compromised.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing password validation THEN the system SHALL use cryptographic hashing with salt
2. WHEN storing session state THEN the system SHALL use secure, time-limited tokens
3. IF multiple failed attempts occur THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting or temporary lockouts
4. WHEN generating authentication tokens THEN the system SHALL use cryptographically secure random generation
5. WHEN the session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically require re-authentication

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want to be able to update passwords and manage access without republishing the entire Framer project, so that I can maintain security efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN passwords need to be changed THEN the system SHALL support remote password updates
2. WHEN managing multiple protected pages THEN the system SHALL support different passwords for different content
3. IF emergency access revocation is needed THEN the system SHALL provide immediate lockout capabilities
4. WHEN monitoring access THEN the system SHALL provide basic analytics on authentication attempts
5. WHEN configuring the system THEN it SHALL support both single-password and multi-user scenarios
